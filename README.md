# EncodingNet
This ia an open-source repo for an accepted paper, `EncodingNet: A Novel Encoding-based MAC Design for Efficient Neural Network Acceleration`, on `IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Artificial Intelligence (TCASAI)`. 

The codes in this repo will be well-structured and updated in the following weeks.

## Pretrained models
|  Dataset   | Online Models  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| CIFAR-10  | [https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10](https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10) |
| CIFAR-100  | [https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100) |

## CGP (Cartesian Genetic Programming) package
`cgp` is a modified package which is copied from [https://zenodo.org/records/3889163](https://zenodo.org/records/3889163)

## User-defined encoding package
`encode_tools` is a user-defined package which includes functions related to encoding.

## User-defined model package
`models` is a user-defined package which implement encoding techniques on modified `Linear` and `Conv2d` layers.

## CGP search
`Code_1_CGP_search.py` is used to apply CGP search process.

## Fine-tune neural networks
The following files are used to apply searched encodings, fine-tune encoding-based neural networks, and test for accuracies. 
|File|Dataset|Model|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|`Code_2_finetune_cifar10.py`|CIFAR-10|ResNet-18|
|`Code_3_finetune_cifar100.py`|CIFAR-100|ResNet-20|
|`Code_4_finetune_imagenet.py`|ImageNet|ResNet-50|
